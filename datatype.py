# Python Data Types
# Built-in Data Types
# In programming, data type is an important concept.

# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

# Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

# Text Type:	str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	dict
# Set Types:	set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	bool
# Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# None Type:	NoneType
# Getting the Data Type
# You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

    
x = 5
print(type(x))
y = "sarita"
print(type(y))
z = 0.8
print(type(z))
